# 📝 To-Do List Web App

A **simple yet effective** To-Do List application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** as part of my **HexSoftwares Internship**.  
This app allows you to **add, mark, and delete tasks**, while saving them locally so they remain even after you close or refresh the browser.
